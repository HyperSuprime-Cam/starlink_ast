[LSST](https://www.lsst.org) fork of [starlink-ast](https://github.com/Starlink/ast),
a library for handling world coordinate systems in Astronomy.

This fork adds two features:
- Support for managing the package with [eups](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/eups)
(the `ups` directory and its contents).
- A set of build files that are usually generated by Starlink build tools, to allow building the package
without those tools.

Note that the license for `starlink-ast` is found in the file [COPYING.LESSER](./COPYING.LESSER)
