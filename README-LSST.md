[LSST](https://www.lsst.org) fork of [starlink-ast](https://github.com/Starlink/ast),
a library for handling world coordinate systems in Astronomy.

This fork adds two features:
- Support for managing the package with [eups](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/eups)
(the `ups` directory and its contents).
- A set of build files that are usually generated by Starlink build tools, to allow building the package
without those tools.

The license for `starlink-ast` is found in the file [COPYING.LESSER](./COPYING.LESSER)


To build and install starlink_ast using eups:

    eupspkg PRODUCT=starlink_ast VERSION=<version> FLAVOR=generic config
    eupspkg PRODUCT=starlink_ast VERSION=<version> FLAVOR=generic build
    eupspkg PRODUCT=starlink_ast VERSION=<version> FLAVOR=generic install
    eupspkg PRODUCT=starlink_ast VERSION=<version> FLAVOR=generic decl

where you replace `<version>` with the desired version name for eups.
You may safely ignore warnings such as:

    configure: found predist marker file version.h.in
    configure: WARNING: In postdistribution state, but predist marker file version.h.in is present



If `ast_err.msg` is updated then somebody with `messgen` must run it to `ast_err.h` and `AST_ERR` (add `-v` for a more verbose build):

    messgen -c -F ast_err.msg

If you forget then builds will fail because the missing error codes will be listed as undeclared.


If `configure.ac` or `Makefile.am` are updated then somebody with the starlink build tools (e.g. Tim Jeness), will have to run `configure` to update various build files.
